This is an informal license. It won't be exact. I don't like that it's not exact, but when I try to make it exact, it turns into purple prose.
=====
This license applies to my music where possible. I don't know if I can put them on arrangements of modern pieces.

You are free to use and modify this music however you want. But if you share it with someone else (places like YouTube count), you need to do the following.
*Attach a LINK to this license. I sometimes realize that something here is unclear and need to clarify.
An attached license won't update itself, but a link will point to the new version just fine without anyone needing to do anything.
*Specify how to reproduce all reproducible files. If a file was generated from other files using a computer program, it is reproducible.
In particular, no one should have to pay for a piece of software to reproduce a file, even if they can download a copy of the file.
*Give credit to the author whose music you're using.
