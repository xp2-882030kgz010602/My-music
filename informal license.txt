This is an informal license. It won't be exact. I don't like that it's not exact, but when I try to make it exact, it turns into purple prose.
This license is written according to my ideals.
=====
This license applies to my music where possible. I don't know if I can put them on arrangements of modern pieces.
It also applies to my palettes and resource packs.

You are free to use and modify this item (music/palette/resource pack) however you want. But if you share it with someone else (places like YouTube count), you need to do the following.
*Specify how to reproduce all reproducible files that you didn't get from somewhere else. If a file was generated from other files using a computer program, it is reproducible.
Be as specific as possible. Tell us what software was used, and what version was used.
In particular, no one should have to pay for a piece of software to reproduce a file, even if they can download a copy of the file.
*If the reproducible file came from somewhere else, provide a link with credit to that file and instructions on reproduction. Same logic with linking to this license.
*Give free downloads to all nonreproducible files.

In other words, if someone wants a copy of all the relevant files, they should be able to get one.

There are a few other requirements too:
*Attach a LINK to this license. I sometimes realize that something here is unclear and need to clarify, or realize that I forgot to mention something and need to mention it.
An attached license won't update itself, but a link will point to the new version just fine without anyone needing to do anything.
*Give credit to the author whose item you're using.

It is okay to sell a sheet music book if you also provide a free download to an equivalent PDF.
