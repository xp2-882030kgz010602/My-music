I once again felt like rewriting this because I felt like I wasn't clear enough the last time.

I am not a lawyer, and cannot guarantee that this license covers all edge cases and things of that nature.
If you have any questions, just open an issue on this GitHub repo and ask.

Having gone through intense pain trying to transcribe Freedom Dive, I do not want any such pain to be inflicted by my music.
Thus, I have a few simple requirements to make sure that this won't happen.

If you use my music to make something else, you must do the following:

1. If you make a file from other files, you must describe exactly how you did so (programs used, settings, etc.),
and you must provide all of these "other files" for free which themselves aren't generated. These files may not be obfuscated.
For "other files" that came from somewhere else, you must link to that "somewhere else", and give credit.
If I use file A to make file C, then use file B and file C to make file D, I must provide files A and B,
but I do not have to provide files C and D, since both C and D were made from other files.
Your process cannot use paid software. Some people simply do not have the means to pay,
and paid software in the process would prevent them from following your process.
Your process cannot use free trials of paid software,
because your process would then be unusable once the free trial expired.
You may not obfuscate files, because obfuscation makes said files harder to work with.

2. You must use this license on your "something else", specifically by linking back here:
https://github.com/xp2-882030kgz010602/My-music/blob/main/informal%20license.txt
This clause serves twofold.
One: By requiring this license to be used on derivative works,
we can guarantee that second-order derivative works and higher remain accessible
under the protections of the first clause.
Two: By requiring this license to be linked to instead of copied,
this means that you do not have to update your copy of the license
whenever I update this license.

3. This is less of a *requirement*, and more of a *note*.
Agreement to this license implies agreement to future versions of this license,
but **only** if the future version of this license clarifies something or patches loopholes.
If I "turn evil" and this license becomes proprietary, your agreement is **not** implied.
