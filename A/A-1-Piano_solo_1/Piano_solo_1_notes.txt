Honestly, I'm not really a fan of this piece. I don't feel like it's bad, but I feel like I have better music.
Since I have already written this piece, I feel like it's worth sharing anyways, but don't get your hopes up.
=====
This is technically my third piano composition; the first one was written in 2012 or so and is lost, and something similar is true for the second one, though I do have vague recollections of what the second one sounded like.
I believe that this composition was written in late 2015 or so.
Credit to Bach for most of the melodies in here; the C#m and Fm sections draw heavily from his C#m fugue and Em prelude from the first book of his well-tempered clavier.
Also included is the original copy of the composition; I wrote this one on paper. I have had to redact personal information.

The manuscript is filled with hilariously misspelled notes. I have attempted to correct note spellings when copying the manuscript into MuseScore.
I did not understand why notes were spelled the way they were; I instead tried to spell notes in a way that minimized the number of natural signs used or something like that.
Or maybe it was "avoid using two different accidentals on the same note in the same measure, like F# then Fb"? I honestly don't remember.
If I remember correctly, I had also assumed that accidentals on a note applied to ALL instances of that note on the same clef, even if they were on a different octave.

This is my recollection of how I composed this piece:
I had heard that composers like Chopin used chromatic scales in their music, so I decided to try it too, resulting in the B minor section.
I discovered that using chromatic scales was hard! In an attempt to continue using weird time signatures, I used a 7/8 then 5/4, in a transition to C#m.
That is where the first Bach melody comes in. I stayed in 4/4 for the rest of the piece so that I could "properly" use the Bach melodies, whatever "properly" means.
There are some weird slash markings on page 8 when modulating to Fm; I had had an interesting idea for modulating to Fm.
I believe that it was some notation for "start at some neighboring note and then move to the written note" or vice versa, but I don't remember exactly what.
Either way, it's nonstandard notation, and as I've said, I don't remember what it means. I have chosen to simply omit it entirely when copying it into MuseScore.
After modulating to Fm, I used a second Bach melody, but I ran out of ideas so I simply ended the piece there.
