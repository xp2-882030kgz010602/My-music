This is a remix of my Waterfall Etude done by silver.
=====
Upon a friend's suggestion, we found some music producers who remixed the etude and sent over the MIDIs (see my informal license).
Unfortunately, we both forgot that you also need a soundfont to produce the audio, and haven't been able to get said soundfont.
This means that the MP3s they sent us are not reproducible. This is why the next section exists.
=====
The MIDIs they sent us are in the Midis folder. Using Domino (this version specifically: https://github.com/Hans5958/Domino-English-Translation)
, I merged the midis into combined.mid, and opened that in MuseScore 2.2.1 and cranked the import resolution as high as it would go.
I then did some editing in MuseScore, and saved the result as all.mscz. I tried to make this sound like the MP3s they sent over to us.
At this point, I feel like it goes against my ideals to not send over the MP3s too, so they can be found in the references folder.
Please excuse the weird names. I never got a V1.mp3 or V1.wav, except for "waterfall  silver.mp3", which I guess could be considered to be a V1.mp3.
Note that V2.wav and V3.wav have had to be compressed to get them onto GitHub.
