This is a remix of my Waterfall Etude done by ink.
=====
The story is similar to that as with misc/Waterfall silver. However, the only audio file I have is "waterfall ink 3.wav".
I don't have a "waterfall ink 2.wav" or a "waterfall ink 1.wav".
For unknown reasons, the midis in the Midis/ folder appear to be inaccurate to the audio file.
all.mid is the one that I combined using Domino (this version specifically: https://github.com/Hans5958/Domino-English-Translation).

The version of 1hrloop.mp4 on YouTube uses the first uploaded version of-honestly, I'm not sure.
There isn't even a midi or mscz behind this one; it's all mp3 here.
