I have decided to drop all mp4s and mp4 download links. These files can be massive, and are a pain to upload and update.
All of these mp4s can be recreated at home using the processes described in the various notes.
EDIT: I have forgotten to list a few exceptions.
mp4s and links to mp4s associated with misc/waterfall-silver and misc/waterfall-ink will be kept.
