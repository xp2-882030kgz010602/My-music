This was also written in late 2015 or so.
Again, the manuscript is included. Again, I have redacted personal information.
You may notice that there's a key signature change in the MSCZ that wasn't in the manuscript.
No notes were actually changed, but since I had decided to "randomly" enter E major for a bit, that I might as well also change the key signature too in MuseScore.
Note that I still followed the "all octaves" accidental convention that I discussed with Piano solo 1.
At least I apparently didn't try to "optimize accidentals" the way I did when writing down Piano solo 1.

Inspired by a (single-voice) recorder composition written by a classmate, I had decided to try writing something polyphonic, because the idea sounded cool to me.
If I remember correctly, the first few measures were taken from that composition, with some rhythm changes, but the rest is me.
You may notice that some notes written on the same voice on the manuscript are now separated in the MSCZ.
This was because at the time I wrote this composition, I hadn't yet grasped the finer details of notating multiple voices.
Additional note: I remember letting the middle voice dive into the left hand with the lower voice, since I thought that it would be funny to force the performer to play two 8th note lines simultaneously with one hand.
I still sometimes do these kinds of things, not as a joke, but as a challenge instead.
Even in 2015, I made sure that my joke did not affect the quality of the music (in my ears; you might disagree).

I believe that quarter note=120 is close to what I had imagined when I originally wrote the composition, though it was not written on the manuscript. If you don't like it, feel free to change it.
