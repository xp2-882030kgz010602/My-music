I have been using filehosting.org to host large downloads as it was the only service that let me conveniently do so for free.
However, between 11/30/2022 and 12/3/2022, filehosting.org has been revamped, making it useless for this purpose.

"We allow up to 50 files per upload and a total of 1GB of storage per user.
Files that have not been accessed for more than 30 days will be deleted."

The next best thing is Google Drive, but that would require me to keep creating new accounts due to the 15GB-per-account limit.

Now, it must be noted that I don't actually need to upload these files, as they can be recreated from other files on GitHub.
That is why I don't require uploads of those files (also since things like this can happen).
However, I personally would like to upload said files.

Given that I cannot find anything else that works like filehosting.org used to, this is what I'll do.
The new year is coming in around 30 days. If I have not found anything better since then, I will upload to Google Drive.

RIP filehosting.org (????-2022)
