This is a study off of Bach's D major prelude from his WTC book 1.
The right hand plays double arpeggios throughout nearly the entire etude.
In a way, this makes it the counterpart to Etude 1/1, which has left hand double arpeggios instead.
However, the left hand also plays fast double notes here, as opposed to the slow octaves that the right hand plays in 1/1.
In addition, the right hand arpeggios here are more complicated, likely making this etude harder than 1/1!

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
