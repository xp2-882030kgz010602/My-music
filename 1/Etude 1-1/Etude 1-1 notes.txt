Etude 1/1: River. An etude in left-hand double arpeggios. This piece is inspired by Liszt's Un Sospiro Etude, and it really shows.
I believe that this is the first etude of the set that I composed; the harmony is a bit clunkier than with the other etude.

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
The same thing applies to the pedal markings in this piece.
I wrote this piece in 2019, but added in pedal markings in 2022.
I have also manually turned down the velocity of the left hand notes in MuseScore from 80 to 40 (2022).
