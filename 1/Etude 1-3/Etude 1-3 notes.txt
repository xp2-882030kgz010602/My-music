Etude 1/3: Ocean Waves.
This etude was inspired by Chopin Etude Opus 10 Number 11.

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
The same thing applies to the pedal markings in this piece.
Note that although the piece was written in 2019, the pedal markings were added in in 2022.
I remember trying to play this piece before, and the pedal markings I have here are what I believe I used then.
However, my recollections may not be entirely accurate.
