I am terrible at writing essays, so when I was given an essay assignment back in 9th grade, this is how I felt about it.
This etude is written for the right hand alone.
While the beginning is in D major, I feel like the piece overall is in D minor.
The 2019 version is at ./Etude 1-15 2019.mscz. I felt like it could be improved a little, so I revised it in 2022.
Here, it is worth noting that this piece is kind of similar to Liszt's Mazeppa etude.

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
