I wrote this piece as a joke, not understanding that parallel fourths were fine even though parallel fifths weren't,
and not realizing that the parallel fifths thing only applied in counterpoint.
Despite the fact that I wrote this piece as a joke, I quite like it anyways.
I was not thinking of Chopin's Etude 25/7 at the time, but I have since realized that there are structural similarities.
I know that there is a paper manuscript for part of this piece, BUT I do not know where it currently is.
I may not be able to find it.
