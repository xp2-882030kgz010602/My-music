This is an etude in sixths, based off of Chopin's etude 25/6. The original version is at ./Etude 1-6 2019.mscz.
It turned out that Reger apparently had the same idea as me, creating something almost identical as the 2019 version of this etude.
(See study 4 here: https://imslp.org/wiki/5_Spezialstudien_(Reger,_Max) )
As a result, I decided to revise mine. You will see hints of Godowsky in the left hand structure as well.
Note that the left hand has a lot of gigantic chords, and quite a few of them will have to be rolled.
Due to hands varying between people, I have simply chosen to let the performer choose which chords to roll.

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
