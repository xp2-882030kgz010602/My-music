This is a study off of Bach's C minor prelude from his WTC book 1 for the right hand alone.
I originally wrote this in 2019, but the 2019 version is basically the original version on one hand, with basically nothing from me.
This is why I have revised this etude in 2022.
Note how here, the right hand goes back and forth between the "melody" and "bass" notes.

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
