This is an etude inspired by Chopin's Harp Etude, and my hate of Mondays because school.
I know that there is a paper manuscript for part of this piece, BUT I do not know where it currently is.
I may not be able to find it.

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
Unlike with a bunch of the other etudes, the pedal markings here were NOT added in 2022; they were added in 2020.
(Note: The piece itself was composed in 2019.)
The velocity changes HAVE been added in 2022. The first note of each beat is kept at 80; everything else is 60.
