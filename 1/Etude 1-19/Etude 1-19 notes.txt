An arrangement of Danza de la Moza Donosa!
Most of my changes from the 2020 score were to add pedal markings and change tempo markings
(and remove messy rolls; check the original file lol),
but there are also a few things that I touched up.
The 2020 version can be found at ./Etude 1-19 2020.mscz.

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
