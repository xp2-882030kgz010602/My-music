An arrangement of Liszt's Un Sospiro Etude. I esssentially tried to flip it over.
I've made some pretty heavy revisions in some part.
The 2020 version is in ./Etude 1-20 2020.mscz.
Similarly to what I did in Etude 1/1, I've manually turned down the velocity of all the "accompaniment" arpeggios from 80 to 60. (2023-2024)
Note: This does not include the bass note right in measure 31 or the last three bats of measure 38,
but does include the RH note in measure 30. This also does not include measures 52 through 57.

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
