Scarlet's Trill. Inspired by Scarlet's Tango (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yRTckbHvVE) by "Music Mommy".
I took the opening trill and wrote a piece using that as a theme. Other than that, I did not use any other material from the piece.
With the exception of measures 108 through 145, this one theme is essentially all this piece has to offer.
Measures 82 through 135 have been modeled after Chopin's etude 10/2.
Measures 172 through 249 have been modeled after Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody 6.
Measures 276 through 301 have been modeled after Liszt's Chromatic Galop.

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
