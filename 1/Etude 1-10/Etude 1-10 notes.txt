Etude 1/10: Waterfall.
This etude was inspired by Chopin Etude Opus 10 Number 1, also commonly known as the Waterfall Etude.
Chopin's etude is also an etude in arpeggios, and is similar to my etude.
The key difference is that while his arpeggios have four notes per group, mine only has three.
=====
Just beware the last few measures. It's going to be hard to play them as quickly as the rest of the piece, but try your best.
Of course, if you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
