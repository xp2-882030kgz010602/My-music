I started sorting my pieces into numbered sets with the 22 or so etudes that make up Etude Set 1. However, I have some older compositions, and to keep them sorted, I wanted to index them too. But it would be confusing if "Etude Set 1" didn't have index 1. To get around this, I use letters for the older compositions.

Here is a list of all published pieces:

A
 A/1: Piano Solo 1
 A/2: Piano Solo 2
1
 Etude 1/2
2
 Etude 2/1

There is also the "misc" index, which means "this doesn't fit nicely with the actual indices".
