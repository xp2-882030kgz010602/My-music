I started sorting my pieces into numbered sets with the 22 or so etudes that make up Etude Set 1. However, I have some older compositions, and to keep them sorted, I wanted to index them too. But it would be confusing if "Etude Set 1" didn't have index 1. To get around this, I use letters for the older compositions.

Here is a list of all published pieces along with when I composed them:

A
 A/1: Piano Solo 1 (likely 2015)
 A/2: Piano Solo 2 (likely 2015)
1
 Etude 1/1 (2019)
 Etude 1/2 (2019)
 Etude 1/10 (2020)
2
 Etude 2/1 (2019)

There is also the "misc" index, which means "this doesn't fit nicely with the actual indices".

 misc/Waterfall silver (by silver; 2022)
 misc/Waterfall ink (by ink; 2022)
