Etude 2/1: Tribute to Crane.
An etude in double notes, and another etude about Wings Of Fire. Why, Icicle, why did you have to kill Crane? :(
This was originally supposed to be Etude 1/9, between Etude 1/8 and the current Etude 1/9.

If you don't like the tempo markings, feel free to ignore them and play the piece at some other speed.
The same thing applies to the pedal markings in this piece.
Note that although the piece was written in 2019, the pedal markings were added in in 2022.
